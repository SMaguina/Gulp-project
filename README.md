# gulp project

This is a project I worked on to get accustomed to running gulp as a javascript task runner. Gulp is a modern front-end developer tool to help with automation of tasks such as compilation, minification, linting code through code analysis, and more. So, in this project I have tested out several plugins created through node package manager to learn about the fullest use of Gulp.

## Requirements

- Install Node
	- on OSX install [home brew](http://brew.sh/) and type `brew install node`
	- on Windows install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
    - Read here for some [tips on Windows](http://jpapa.me/winnode)
    - open command prompt as administrator
        - type `choco install nodejs`
        - type `choco install nodejs.install`
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install -g node-inspector bower gulp`

## Quick Start

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm start
```
